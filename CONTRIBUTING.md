This project is pretty small, so fork and PR whatever you want and let's chat.

# Pushing a Release
## Versioning
Version numbers are manually managed.
Semantic versioning is used.

When a new release is ready:
* set new version number in
  * DESCRIPTION
  * app/ui.R
## Shinyapps.io
Use the RStudio "Publish Document" on app.R, ui.R, or server.R to push as `phytoclass-app`.
